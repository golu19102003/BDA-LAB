# Big Data Analytics Lab
All Programs of the 8th Sem BDA Lab with Outputs in Different Steps. This document contains all practical programs of the Big Data Analytics Lab, covering major concepts such as Hadoop setup, HDFS operations, MapReduce programming, Pig, Hive, and real-life data analytics. Each experiment includes step-by-step execution and output to help students understand distributed data processing. These programs focus on core phases of big data processing such as data storage, data distribution, parallel computation, data mining, and analytics using Hadoop ecosystem tools.

### Importance:
The BDA Lab bridges the gap between theoretical concepts and real-world big data applications. It prepares students for careers in data engineering, data analytics, and distributed systems by providing practical exposure to industry-standard tools and techniques.

### RTU ML Lab Experiement:
**1.** Introduction: Objective, scope, and outcomes of the course & Installation of VMWare.
**2.** Implement the following Data Structures in Java:
i) Linked Lists
ii) Stacks
iii) Queues
iv) Set
v) Map
**3.** Perform setup and installation of Hadoop in:
i) Standalone Mode
ii) Pseudo-Distributed Mode
iii) Fully Distributed Mode
**4.** Implement file management tasks in Hadoop:
i) Adding files and directories
ii) Retrieving files
iii) Deleting files
**5.**  Run a basic Word Count MapReduce program to understand the MapReduce paradigm.
**6.** Write a Map Reduce program that mines weather data. Weather sensors collecting data everyhour at many locations across the globe gather a large volume of log data, which is a goodcandidate for analysis with MapReduce, since it is semi structured and record-oriented.
**7.** Implement Matrix Multiplication using Hadoop MapReduce.
**8.** Write a Map Reduce program that mines weather data. Weather sensors collecting data everyhour at many locations across the globe gather a large volume of log data, which is a goodcandidate for analysis with MapReduce, since it is semi structured and record-oriented.
**9.** Install and Run Hive then use Hive to create, alter, and drop databases, tables, views, functions, and indexes.
**10.** Solve some real life big data problems.
